## Colab. Community Centric Innovation. At Scale.
CoLab is an innovation hub and a collaborative community for startups, innovators, creatives and entrepreneurs. Our purpose is to build a technology ecosystem in and around northern Nigeria, starting from Kaduna.

We are doing so through community centric innovation, peer based, hands-on learning, and a platform that provides the foundation and resources to turn problems into solutions and ideas into products and companies that can scale.

Our co-workspace is an environment that allows your natural curiosity foster learning, inspire creativity and innovation.
